Project Description:
Asset Management system is a system used for the tracking of assets assigned to the employees.
The main aim of the project is to provide a single application where new employees can be added 
and their assets viewed by both employees as well as the administrator.The application was designed
with security kept in mind. The project contains two login formats, one for the administrator and 
one for the employee.The two login systems were designed to provide the flexibility of giving administrative 
rights to dedicated employees and tracking rights to everyone.This project provides a very good user interface 
such that anyone can easily understand and can access the information with least effort.
